# uDEAClassification
Data and code for "Classifying with Uncertain Data Envelopment Analysis" by A. Holder and C. Garner

This code and data archive contains everything to reproduce the results in the aforementioned paper.
There are three subdirectories, those being Prostate_v2, Stocks_v2, and SmallExample, all of which
make use of classifyUtilsParallel.py and uDEA.py. Data is located in the data subdirectories, and
figures are in similarly named subdirectories. The code is written in Python 3 and makes use of Pyomo,
Gurobi, and several standard python modules. Code was originally developed on Fedora Core (version 36
I believe). The files classifyProstate.py, classifyStocks.py, and smallExample.py are commented to
navigate successful runs.

Contact Allen Holder (holder@rose-hulman.edu) or Casey Garner (garne214@umn.edu) for questions.
